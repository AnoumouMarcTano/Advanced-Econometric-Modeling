GDP per capita is a vital indicator of economic prosperity, crucial for measuring a country's performance and guiding development strategies.

Our research focuses on the factors influencing GDP per capita in Japan, a major economic power. We investigate the key elements of its temporal dynamics using various econometric methods, such as endogeneity analysis, multicollinearity (PCR, PLS, Lasso, Ridge), and the study of causal effects through Double Machine Learning.

This work, a result of student collaboration, includes economic modeling, report writing, and the application of various tests, conducted using R.

The data, sourced from the OECD and the World Bank, can be found in the file data_jpn.csv, and the complete report is accessible in the file TANO_NOUCHET_DADJEDJI.pdf.

Although the project achieves its objectives, there is room for improvement. Your recommendations for our future research are therefore invaluable.
